                    <p class="on-read-hook drop-cap">In web design, a hero section is often the first visual element a
                        visitor encounters on a landing page or main page of a website. A hero section is a component
                        taken from a landing page. It informs about the website and gets visitors interested you, your
                        product or anything really. It's acts like a hook to gather attention as much aspossible. In
                        fact upon research <span class="text-qouting-source">"Users often leave Web pages in 10–20
                            seconds, but pages with a clear value proposition can hold people's attention for much
                            longer. To gain several minutes of user attention, you must clearly communicate your value
                            proposition within 10 seconds." </span> according to the
                        <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/"
                            class="credible-source-link" target="_blank">Nielsen Norman Group</a>. </p>

                            <h3 class ="bigsubheader-sections-seperators">The header</h3>
                    <p class="on-readparagraphs">
                        The header of your hero section consists of a headline and a description.
                        The headline's text should be made of what your service does in less then 11 words. The golden
                        area is 8 words. But the less the better.The should be a statement not a question.Usually
                        headlines everywhere are vague. an example like <span class="blank-qouted-text">"The new
                            standard in online payments" </span>from stripe.com or <span
                            class="blank-qouted-text">"Welcome to your new financial home." </span> from stash.com.
                        Their is a good reason for that though.It acts like clickbait. So the visitor now wants to look
                        for answer and that's what the the subhead/description is for. In the subhead mention something
                        outstanding or achievement worthy if you're already well in business. Something like stash.com
                        subhead "Join 3+ million Americans investing, saving, and banking with Stash." It gives you
                        credibility. Name-drop major brands that are using your product. Show social proof! If your just starting a business mention what your product or services will do for
                        your visitor. Also
                        Subheads consist of words more than the headline but shouldn't be more than 3 sentences.
                        separate yourself from competitors, express what's inventive about your service/product, state
                        how it will make individuals' lives simpler or better, or state how it will take care of a
                        noteworthy issue.


                    </p>

                    <h3 class=" bigsubheader-sections-seperators"> What if your website is not a business or about a
                        product your trying to sell? </h3>
                    <p class="on-readparagraphs">Even if the site is not about product/service it's still very important
                        to have hero section. For example if it's a blog,news website, or really any type of niche
                        it's alot less work than selling your product. Just be upfront with headline and the subheading.
                        Well come back to this later.</p>

                    <h3 class=" bigsubheader-sections-seperators">Hero Image</h3>
                    <p class="on-readparagraphs">Hero images are critical element when capturing the viewers attention.
                        The most common example of a hero image is a background image, background-color or a video on a
                        loop behind the text covering almost half of the viewers screen. like shown below.</p>

                    <h3 class = "bigsubheader-sections-seperators">Old or New?</h3>
                   <p class = "on-readparagraphs"> both hero images are perfect for your website if applied correctly. The newer ones tend to fall under a well thought out color pallete with waves to be complimented with mostly done by svg. You also tend to see more of the bobbly shaped humanoids with objects like computers being simplistic flat design. With the old way though the hero image would include a product shot, a photo of a person using the product, illustration, animation, or a video showing how the product works, or an image showing the outcome of using the product. With the new; you can have more freedom and break the rules a bit. Like blue saplings page you can have your product shown on the side;then the rest of the background can be filled with patterns,shapes,a gradient, you can have the background animated aswell, really anything that can make it more appealing to look at, just make sure your product is still noticeable. But whatever which option you pick make it support your headline and subhead. Also don't use stock photos it makes the website look unauthentic. Hire a pro on fivver or something.</p>
                   <h3 class = "bigsubheader-sections-seperators">Call to actions</h3>
                   <p class = "on-readparagraphs">Notice how some of the images above included alot of buttons? Those are (CTA) short for "call to action". They usually go below the subhead.
                        In big and bold and in a contrasting color.
                        A single CTA is usually just leads for one product. Be as specific as you can in as few words as possible They usually say things like "try for free", "try now" "try "your product here"" " or "sign up now". Their can me more than one CTA button sometimes but make your preferred choice stand out.</p>
                        <h3 class ="bigsubheader-sections-seperators">What about if it's not a service or product?</h3> <p class = "on-readparagraphs">Back to that subject matter. Your website can be about  either  a  blog,news website, your own niche or a free tool whatever it can be. You can still follow the principles mentioned. It doesn't have to have a hero image like shown below. Except I advice raising the headline's and subhead's font-size just a tad higher.</p>
